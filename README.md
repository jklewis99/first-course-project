# first-course-project
The following code is a python script that I used to play sounds from my keyboard. I recorded the sound files and access them through a text file that will then play on the press of a key. Additionally, using my limited understanding of the pygame library, I change the screen to show what keys are being pressed at a given time.

As a first-year, first semester student, I was very proud of my work. Of course, I have since learned that there were many decisions I made that were not the most efficient.

sound_effects_function.py contains the method that will play certain sound effects from some of my favorite movies and display an image from that movie.

keyboard_function.py contains the method that will display a screen with rectangles in a similar shape to the black and white keys of a piano. This method plays the sounds I recorded from playing different notes on the marimba.

play_sound.py simply asks the user to select which method they wish to execute, either Sound Effects or the Marimba. From there, the pygame window opens.
