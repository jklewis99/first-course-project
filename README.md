# first-course-project
The following code is a python script that I used to play sounds from my keyboard. I recorded the sound files and access them through a text file that will then play on the press of a key. Additionally, using my limited understanding of the pygame library, I change the screen to show what keys are being pressed at a given time.

As a first-year, first semester student, I was very proud of my work. Of course, I have since learned that there were many decisions I made that were not the most efficient.
